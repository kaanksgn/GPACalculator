# GPA Calculator
+ I am eager to represent to you my first Dart Project that helps you to calculate your GPA Score.

## Project Looks
+ This is how main page looks.

## Usage
+ You can easily input your Scores by choosing the *Score* & *Credit* and writing *Lecture Name*.
+ Enter button automatically puts the new Lecture into the list and includes new Lecture for calculations.

+ After that, *Number of Lecures* and *Average Score* are calcuated and shown at the top right side of the screen.
+ Also you can see, edit or delete previous *Lectures*.
